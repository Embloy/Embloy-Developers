# How to connect Embloy with Lever

:::info
This guide is for Embloy customers that want to integrate Embloy with a Lever.
:::

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to Embloy! We are excited to have you on board. This guide will explain every step you need to take to connect Embloy with your existing ATS.

## Prerequisites

- You are currently using Lever

## Step 1: Create an account

If you haven't already, you can create an Embloy account by visiting our [registration page](https://embloy.com/register). You can also sign up using your Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, or GitHub accounts.

After you have created an account, you will receive a confirmation email. Click on the link in the email to verify your account.

_[More information](/docs/category/account)_

## Step 2: Subscribe to Embloy

[Choose a plan and subscribe](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=billing) to Embloy. We partner up with Stripe to process payments, so you don't have to worry about us storing or processing any sensitive information.

_[More information](/docs/category/subscriptions)_

## Step 3: Setting up the integration

:::note
If anything is unclear, follow the instructions shown in your ATS and if necessary, see their documentation and guides.
:::

1. Navigate to [Embloy's Recruiters Dashboard](https://genius.embloy.com).

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex flex-col", width: "90%" }}>
    - Go to **Settings** > [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations).
    <!--<img
      src={require("/img/integrations/lever/lever-oauth.png").default}
      alt="Lever Genius OAuth"
      style={{ marginTop: "2%", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}/>-->
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex flex-col", width: "90%" }}>
    - Select Lever and press _Connect_.
    <!--<img
      src={require("/img/integrations/lever/lever-oauth.png").default}
      alt="Lever Accept OAuth"
      style={{ marginTop: "2%", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}/>-->
  </div>
</div>

2. Sign into your Lever account and then authorize Embloy by pressing _Accept_.
![Lever Accept OAuth](/img/integrations/lever/lever-accept-oauth.png)

3. To synchronize the application stage of a candidate, please enable the _Candidate stage change_, _Candidate archive state change_, _Candidate hired_, _Interview created_, _Interview updated_ and _Interview deleted_ webhooks in Lever by going to **Settings** \> **Integrations and API** \> **[Webhooks](https://hire.sandbox.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks)**.
    :::tip
    If the webhooks don't appear in Lever's **[Webhooks](https://hire.sandbox.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks)**-tab, you can reset them manually by clicking _Reset Webhooks_ in the [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations)-tab of Embloy's Recruiter Dashboard.
    :::

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-webhooks.png)

:::warning
Since Lever doesn't provide a Webhook for updates of your postings' application forms, **whenever you create or edit a posting**, you will have to press _Refresh postings_ in the **Integrations** tab of Embloy's Recruiter Dashboard.
:::

## Step 4: Using the Embloy integration

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **[Posting Templates](https://hire.lever.co/settings/site?tab=posting-templates)**.

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-template.png)

2. Create a new template or update an existing one with the following line that links to `https://apply.embloy.com/lever`: 
    ```
    APPLY WITH EMBLOY
    ```
   

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-template-new.png)

3. Save the template and use it in your job postings.

4. Users should now be able to apply to your postings using their Embloy account by pressing _Apply with Embloy_.

## Conclusion

### Receive applications via your ATS

- Now that you have connected your ATS, applications submitted through Embloy will automatically be sent there so that you can process your applications as usual.

- If you need to, you can also log into our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/), screen the applications and respond to the candidates directly. However, if you are using Embloy as an integration and not as a standalone tool, we recommend you to manage your applications directly via your ATS.
