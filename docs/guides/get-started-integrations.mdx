# How to connect Embloy with your ATS

:::info
This guide is for Embloy customers that want to integrate Embloy with a 3rd-party service that partners with Embloy. If you are a current or potential partner, please refer to the [Partners guide](/docs/guides/get-started-partners) or contact us directly.
:::

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Embloy! We are excited to have you on board. This guide will explain every step you need to take to connect Embloy with your existing ATS.

## Prerequisites

- You are currently using an external ATS system

- The ATS system has an Embloy integration

## Step 1: Create an account

If you haven't already, you can create an Embloy account by visiting our [registration page](https://embloy.com/register). You can also sign up using your Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, or GitHub accounts.

After you have created an account, you will receive a confirmation email. Click on the link in the email to verify your account.

_[More information](/docs/category/account)_

## Step 2: Subscribe to Embloy

[Choose a plan and subscribe](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=billing) to Embloy. We partner up with Stripe to process payments, so you don't have to worry about us storing or processing any sensitive information.

## Step 3: Enable the integration

  :::note
  If anything is unclear, follow the instructions shown in your ATS and if necessary, see their documentation and guides.
  :::

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-between" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex flex-col", width: "90%" }}>
    - Go to your ATS provider's admin dashboard and enable the Embloy integration. For most providers, this will prompt you to create a new API key
    <img
      src={require("./enable-integration.png").default}
      alt="Enable Integration"
      style={{ marginTop: "2%", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}/>
  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "flex flex-col", width: "90%" }}>
    - If necessary, select the correct permissions (read job postings + read/write applications)
    <img
      src={require("./enable-integration-2.png").default}
      alt="Enable Integration"
      style={{ marginTop: "2%", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}/>
  </div>
</div>

## Step 4: Exchange API keys

### Upload ATS provider's API key to Embloy

Copy and paste the API key into a new Embloy secret in the "secrets" tab of your [Embloy Genius settings](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=secrets). 
  :::important
  **Make sure to select the name of the 3rd-party for the `issuer` option, as the API key can't be used otherwise**.

### Upload Embloy's client token to ATS provider 

Finally, create a new `client_token` in the "secrets" tab of your [Embloy Genius settings](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=secrets) and paste it into your ATS provider's Embloy integration 
  :::note
  By default, the `client_token` expires after three months, but you can customize it up to one year. However, once expired, you will have to create and upload a new one.

## Conclusion

### Receive applications via your ATS

- Now that you have connected your ATS, applications submitted through Embloy will automatically be sent there so that you can process your applications as usual

- If you need to, you can also log into our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/), screen the applications and respond to the candidates directly. However, if you are using Embloy as an integration and not as a standalone tool, we recommend you to manage your applications directly via your ATS
