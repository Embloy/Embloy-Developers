# About account secrets

Embloy allows you to store sensitive information ("secrets"), such as access tokens, client tokens or 3rd party API keys which are neccessary to enable integrations.

:::warning
Keep in mind to **not share** your tokens with anyone. While you can [deactivate tokens](./secrets#deactivate-secrets) issued by Embloy, 3rd-party API keys can only be edited and managed using the respective 3rd-party service.  
:::

## Manage secrets

To list and manage your secrets, you can simply check on the "secrets" tab in your [Embloy Genius settings](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=secrets).

You can also use our [REST API](https://docs.embloy.com/#61115343-81ab-4df4-a6e2-47db9accb0ab) to create, update, delete, and retrieve information about secrets that can be used in Embloy workflows and integrations.

## Deactivate secrets

If you want to deactivate a certain secret, you can do so by selecting the secret in the "secrets" tab of your [Embloy Genius settings](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=secrets) and pressing on the "deactivate secret" button. If a secret has been deactivated, it can't be used until it is reactivated. You can deactivate and reactivate secrets as many times as you want, as long as they are not expired.

:::note
To avoid the unnecessary storage of sensitive information, expired tokens will automatically be deleted one month after expiration.
:::

## Upload 3rd-party API keys

To enable certain integrations, you will have to upload an API key issued by the third party service to Embloy. To do so, follow the instructions of the 3rd-party and once generated, simply copy and paste the API key into a new Embloy-secret in the "secrets" tab of your [Embloy Genius settings](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=secrets). **Make sure to select the name of the 3rd party for the `issuer` option, as the API key can't be used otherwise**.

:::note
Only sandbox users or users with a valid [Embloy subscription](/docs/category/subscriptions) are allowed to create and update tokens.
:::

:::info
Rest assured that all secrets are first encrypted and then stored using a [symmetric-key algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm). If you have any concerns, please contact us and we'll do our best to help you.

## Embloy secrets

Embloy secrets are structured as follows:

| Field                | Allowed Values                                                              | Default Value                                                                         |

| `expires_at`         | Any valid ISO 8601 date string in the future                                | (depends on token type, but usually between one hour and one year)                    |
| `issued_at`          | Any valid ISO 8601 date string in the past                                  | (current time)                                                                        |

| `active`             | `true`, `false`                                                             | true                                                                                  |
| `scopes`             | Any string                                                                  | N/A                                                                                   |

:::note
Please note that the unencrypted `token` value is not saved anywhere and only visible when:

1. _You explicitly request access to it via the Genius dashboard_

or

    2. _when it is required to call a 3rd-party API_
