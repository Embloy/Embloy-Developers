Hello Everyone,

Webhooks are now a first-class citizen in Embloy! With our latest update, you can automate your recruitment workflow and integrate Embloy with virtually any external system.

## How Webhooks Work

Whenever a candidate applies, updates their profile, or moves through your hiring pipeline, Embloy can send real-time notifications to your chosen endpoint. This enables seamless integration with ATS platforms, Slack channels, or custom dashboards.

### Example Use Cases

- **Instant Notifications:** Get a Slack message every time a new application is received.
- **ATS Sync:** Automatically update candidate status in Lever, Greenhouse, or Ashby.
- **Custom Analytics:** Feed application data into your BI tools for deeper insights.

## Getting Started

Setting up webhooks is simple:
1. Go to your Embloy dashboard and navigate to **Settings > Webhooks**.
2. Add your endpoint URL and select the events you want to subscribe to.
3. Test your webhook with our built-in simulator.

## Security & Reliability

All webhook payloads are signed and delivered over HTTPS. You can monitor delivery status and retry failed events from your dashboard.

Let us know how you're using webhooks, and share your automation stories with the community!

Best,

The Embloy Team
