Hello Everyone,

As part of our wind-down process, we've released a set of migration tools to help you securely export your data and transition to another platform. Whether you're a small team, enterprise customer or free-tier user, we hope this helps you export your data with minimal effort.

In addition, we’ve published detailed guides for common migration paths, including to platforms like Lever, Ashby, and others. You can access these in your dashboard under `Settings` → `Export & Migration`. If you need hands-on support, just reach out—we’re happy to assist you one-on-one.

Best,

The Embloy Team
