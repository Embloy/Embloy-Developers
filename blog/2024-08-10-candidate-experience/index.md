We often hear that the candidate experience is one of the most critical aspects of recruitment. At Embloy, we believe that a great candidate experience is often the key to attracting and retaining top talent. That’s why we’ve designed our platform to prioritize candidates at every step of the application process.

## For Businesses of All Sizes

- **Local Businesses:** Use Embloy QR codes to attract staff who already love your business.
- **Enterprises:** Integrate Embloy with your ATS and start receiving applications in minutes.

Embloy is designed to be the fastest, smoothest, and most user-centric way to apply for any job with a single account. Candidates don’t have to keep entering the same information or write long emails—they can apply in seconds, anytime, anywhere.

## Embloy: PayPal for Jobs

Think of Embloy as PayPal for job applications. Create an account once and use it everywhere. Candidates enjoy a smooth application experience, and recruiters get better, faster hires.

- **Unified Dashboard:** Applicants manage all their applications and communications in one place.
- **Direct Line to Recruiters:** Talent acquisition teams can stick to their established workflows and operate Embloy out of their ATS.
- **No Substitution, Just Upgrade:** Embloy isn’t an ATS or HRIS tool. It works on top of your existing systems, consolidating application processes into one platform.
