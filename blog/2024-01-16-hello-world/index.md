Hello Everyone,

we're delighted to share that Embloy's Developer Docs have just made their debut!

Embloy is designed to be an application gateway that allows everyone to apply for any job on any website, all within the simplicity of a single account and minimal integration overhead (< 10 LOC).

<!--truncate-->

Now, let's get back to the Docs. Here, you'll find a quick [starter guide](/docs/intro), our [SDKs](/docs/sdks/overview), [tutorials](/docs/category/tutorial---basics) with examples ready for implementation, and [comprehensive guides](/docs/category/guides) on how to integrate Embloy.

Expect frequent updates, refinements, and perhaps a few surprises and ~~bugs~~ _features_ along the way.

Best,

The Embloy Team
