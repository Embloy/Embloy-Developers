Hello Everyone,

We want to remind everyone that our service will go offline on 30th June 2025 at 23:59 UTC. After this time, you will no longer be able to log into the platform, and all live integrations and APIs will cease to function.

<!--truncate-->

Before this date, we strongly encourage all users to download their full data exports. We’ve also created a read-only archive mode for the last 72 hours to help those making final backups. Our support inbox (help@embloy.com) will remain open for 6 additional months after shutdown for any issues.

If you’re unsure whether you’ve exported everything correctly, don’t hesitate to contact us. We’d rather double-check with you than risk you losing any data.

Best,

The Embloy Team
