Hello Everyone,

After long internal discussions and careful consideration, we’ve made the decision to sunset our services and wind down the company over the coming months. While we’re proud of what we’ve built and grateful for the incredible support we’ve received from our customers and community, the current market conditions and our long-term sustainability goals have led us to this point.

Our platform will remain active for the next 100 days to give you time to export your data and complete any pending workflows. During this period, our support team will remain fully available to assist with any questions or migration needs. We want this transition to be as smooth as possible and are here to help at every step.

We’ll be sharing more details in the coming weeks, including specific timelines, migration tools, and export options. In the meantime, we encourage you to start planning your data exports and consider alternative platforms that may suit your needs.

If you have any immediate questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team at [help@embloy.com](mailto:help@embloy.com).

Best,

The Embloy Team
